/*
 * # Small Idea: Thread being_moved locking
 *
 * ## Credits: gummi
 *
 * ## Context: This flag is used to ensure that everyone reads an accurate
 *             `last_ran` field on a thread. Basically, READY threads can be
 *             arbitrarily migrated at any time if it is possible. All
 *             migrations must occur whilst both scheduler locks are held.
 *
 *             Threads also have to have their core's scheduler lock
 *             acquired when the being_moved is being locked.
 *
 * ## Problem: We need to guarantee that this lock is used appropriately
 *             alongside thread flags to make sure that an invalid
 *             last_ran field is NEVER read. This must be done
 *             because if an invalid last_ran field is read, we will
 *             lock the WRONG scheduler and can cause catastrophic races.
 *
 * ## Strategy: Upon any thread migration within the scheduler, we spin
 *              on the lock and try to set it. Upon any read of the
 *              thread's last_ran field, we spin on the lock and wait
 *              for it to become free but never set it. Prior to any
 *              spin_raw on the lock from outside the scheduler,
 *              we ALWAYS set the thread as NO_STEAL so that it cannot
 *              possibly be migrated after the lock is available.
 *
 *              Every time we read the flags to see if the thread can
 *              be migrated, we must hold the lock prior to reading the
 *              flags, and release the lock if we are able to migrate
 *              the thread and only after we set last_ran.
