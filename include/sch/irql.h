/* # Big Idea: IRQLs (STABLE)
 *
 * ## Credits: gummi

 * ## Audience:
 *   Everyone
 *
 *   > IRQLs play a major role in the preemption and interrupt
 *     control mechanisms of this kernel. Thus, this document regarding
 *     the details of the IRQLs and usages is quite important.
 *
 * ## Overview:
 *   IRQLs provide a centralized preemption and interrupt control mechanism.
 *   IRQLs are software only, meaning they are strictly enforced only by
 *   software and used as an abstraction in software.
 *
 * ## Background:
 *   IRQLs are a feature of quite a few other kernels. Windows NT is the
 *   most prominent of the many kernels that have IRQLs. Similar concepts exist
 *   in other kernels, however.
 *
 * ## Summary:
 *   Each logical processor (or CPU) on the machine has its own IRQL.
 *
 *   At each IRQL, the effects of lower IRQLs are also applied.
 *   There are 5 IRQLs, ordered from the least restrictive to most restrictive:
 *
 *     - PASSIVE (standard code execution, nothing blocked)
 *     - APC (APCs[^1] blocked)
 *     - DISPATCH (DPCs[^2] blocked, preemption blocked)
 *     - DEVICE (same as DISPATCH, currently reserved for future use)
 *     - HIGH (hardware interrupts blocked)
 *
 *   To change the IRQL, a function call to raise or lower it must be made.
 *   This is because the raise/lower operation must invoke otherfunctions
 *   to block other events (such as preemption or interrupts). This means
 *   that you cannot change the current IRQL willy-nilly and expect everything
 *   to work out just fine.
 *
 *   ### Bootstage exception:
 *
 *   There is also another "pseudo-IRQL" that is used as a placeholder so that
 *   IRQL functions can be called at early bootstages[^3] (making the IRQL
 *   functions effectively no-ops), which is NONE.
 *
 * ## API:
 *   There are three primary IRQL related functions:
 *
 *   `irql_raise()`, `irql_lower()`, and `irql_get()`.
 *
 *   `irql_raise()` raises the IRQL to a new IRQL, returning
 *   the previous IRQL. If the machine has not reached the LATE_DEVICES
 *   bootstage, it will not do anything and will return the NONE IRQL.
 *
 *   If this new IRQL is equal to the current IRQL, nothing is done.
 *   However, if the new IRQL is *lower* than the current IRQL, the function
 *   will panic.
 *
 *   `irql_lower()` lowers the IRQL to a new IRQL. If the bootstage has
 *   not reached the LATE_DEVICES stage, *or* if the NONE IRQL is passed in,
 *   the function will not do anything.
 *
 *   If the new IRQL is equal to the current IRQL, nothing is done.
 *   However, if the new IRQL is *higher* than the current IRQL, the function
 *   will panic.
 *
 *   `irql_lower()` will also check if any APCs and DPCs have came in, and
 *   execute them if the new IRQL permits the execution of these procedures.
 *
 *   `irql_lower()` will also check if a reschedule is needed, and appropriately
 *   call `scheduler_yield()` if preemption is enabled.
 *
 *   An example of a common IRQL usage pattern for disabling preemption:
 *
 *   ```c
 *   enum irql old_irql = irql_raise(IRQL_DISPATCH_LEVEL); // disable preemption
 *
 *   // do critical work
 *
 *   irql_lower(old_irql);
 *   ```
 *
 *   `irql_get()` will return the current IRQL of the caller's logical
 *   processor.
 *
 * ## Errors:
 *   No errors besides the possible panics described above are possible.
 *
 * ## Context:
 *   IRQL usage interacts with many subsystems, but primarily interacts with
 *   synchronization, interrupt handlers, and scheduling.
 *
 * ## Constraints:
 *   The `irql_raise()` and `irql_lower()` functions cannot call themselves.
 *   Thus, inside the functions, whenever interrupts need to be disabled,
 *   they use the raw `disable_interrupts()` and `enable_interrupts()`
 *   assembly routines.
 *
 * ## Internals:
 *   None
 *
 * ## Strategy:
 *   To raise the IRQL, the necessary operations are performed depending on
 *   the IRQL being raised to. (disable preemption, interrupts, etc.).
 *
 *   To lower the IRQL, we simply re-enable the blocked event types, and
 *   attempt DPC and APC execution if we are currently running in the
 *   context of a thread.
 *
 * ## Rationale:
 *   IRQLs were introduced as the preemption/interrupt control mechanism
 *   of this kernel because of the structure and strict rules they
 *   provide and enforce. DPCs and APCs also require IRQLs.
 *
 * ## Changelog:
 *   11/22/2025 - gummi: created file
 *   11/23/2025 - gummi: move references
 *
 * ## Notes:
 *   I primarily decided to bring IRQLs to this kernel because I had read
 *   code from kernels without IRQLs (with the constant
 *   enable/disable_interrupts, preempt_disable_enable sprinkled about),
 *   and thought "This could really be simplified with a state machine!",
 *   but then realized that VMS and NT basically did that already.
 *   So, I chose to introduce IRQLs.
