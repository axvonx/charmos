/*
 * # Big Idea: Realtime scheduler load balancing (EXPERIMENTAL)
 *
 * ## Credits: axvon
 *
 * ## Audience: Realtime program writers and scheduler interested people
 *
 * ## Overview:
 *
 * Our realtime thread scheduling load balancing philosophy is based around
 * this following "overarching theory statement":
 *
 *
 *         "Always pull, never push."
 *
 *
 * Whenever load balancing occurs, there is always a "positive" party,
 * and a "negative" party.
 *
 * The positive party is the one which gets load removed, and the negative
 * party is the one that gets load added.
 *
 * Within realtime scheduling, some amount of non-determinism will always be
 * present (e.g. the branch predictor decides to evict entries from its BTB,
 * the cache misses a few times here and there, a spinlock is spun on
 * for a few extra cycles).
 *
 * Thus, our goal becomes NOT to completely remove non-determinism, as that
 * becomes somewhat of an infeasible plumbing job, but rather, it is to
 * minimize non-determinism and its harm.
 *
 * ## Background:
 *
 * Realtime scheduler load balancing has long been a topic of great contention
 * in realtime scheduling. Although EDF is a provably optimal algorithm on
 * uniprocessor systems, its performance and optimality is varied on
 * multiprocessor machines.
 *
 * ## Summary:
 *
 * Load balancing in a realtime operating system that supports timesharing
 * scheduling is inherently non-deterministic. The outcome of a load
 * balance is almost entirely dependent on the various loads
 * present on the different nodes and logical processors.
 *
 * However, we can reduce this non-determinism by making the load balancing
 * unidirectional, or in other words, only allowing one kind of migration.
 *
 * There are two main kinds of load migration:
 *
 *    Pushing is when the positive party actively offloads its work
 *    onto the negative party, with the negative party not having
 *    any say in this matter.
 *
 *    Pulling is when the negative party actively takes work from
 *    the positive party, with the positive party not being
 *    able to do much regarding this action.
 *
 * Within realtime scheduling, the impact of the non-determinism from
 * pushing is clearly much more significant and harmful than pulling.
 *
 * Imagine this:
 *    CPU0 is happily running its 3 realtime tasks
 *
 *    CPU1 is unhappily running its 9 realtime tasks
 *
 *    CPU0 is making its way through a long-running compute task,
 *    with 2 more interactive tasks in the queue
 *
 *    CPU1 is switching more rapidly between its 8 tasks
 *
 *    Then, all of a sudden, CPU1 context switches, and
 *    exclaims "I can't take this anymore!",
 *    and it pushes 3 of its tasks onto CPU0.
 *
 *    Now, CPU0 has had an influx of work, but it is still running
 *    its compute task. This brings a major problem:
 *
 *        "The work we just moved will have no guarantee that it is run"
 *
 *    And we can end up in this scenario:
 *
 *    CPU0 is happily running one of its 6 realtime tasks, but
 *    some new tasks are sitting in the queue expecting to
 *    be switched to, but that never happens.
 *
 *    CPU1 is now a bit less frustrated about its load, but now
 *    3 tasks that were originally assigned to it are waiting
 *    in a runqueue, and it no longer is able to choose when
 *    those 3 tasks will get to run again, unless it tracks the
 *    affinity of each of the tasks that it was running and moves them back.
 *
 * Now, compare this to pull-only policies:
 *    CPU0 is happily running its 3 realtime tasks
 *
 *    CPU1 is unhappily running its 9 realtime tasks
 *
 *    CPU0 context switches, and *notices* that CPU1 has
 *    some extra work it can take. It decides to pull it over,
 *    and then immediately run it.
 *
 *    Now, although CPU0 has had work added, this work
 *    is guaranteed runtime after the migration, potentially
 *    allowing it to complete early/giving it more CPU time.
 *
 * From this example, we can see how using pull-only migration provides
 * stricter, deterministic guarantees about whether or not a task will
 * run after being migrated. This is the primary reason why we are
 * choosing this paradigm, in addition to a slight improvement in
 * *when* tasks get migrated (i.e. on the negative party's side, an explicit
 * call to yield the processor must be made for work to be added, as opposed
 * to work pushing where the negative party can randomly get work added.
 *
 * ## API:
 * TODO
 *
 * ## Errors:
 *
 * The modular realtime scheduler system of this kernel *allows realtime
 * schedulers to fail*, and *fails upwards*. TODO
 *
 * ## Context:
 *
 * The realtime scheduler exists under the broader scheduling and multitasking
 * capabilities of this kernel, and exists in contrast to the primary
 * timesharing scheduler which is detailed to a greater extent elsewhere.
 *
 * ## Constraints:
 * TODO
 *
 * ## Internals:
 * TODO
