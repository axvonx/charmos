/*
 * This is the asynchronous block device
 * IO request scheduler, referred to as the
 * "bio scheduler", or "bio sched".
 *
 * ===================== Overview =======================
 *
 * The bio scheduler is a generic block IO scheduler that
 * block devices are expected to implement device-specific
 * policies to allow the scheduler to perform optimizations.
 *
 * The two main device-specific optimizations are coalescing and reordering.
 *
 * Coalescing allows two requests to get merged into one,
 * and reordering simply changes the order in which
 * requests are dispatched, allowing for some block devices
 * to operate more efficiently.
 *
 * When coalescing succeeds, the request with the lower LBA is marked
 * as `is_aggregate`, and the one with the higher LBA is marked `skip`.
 *
 * ===================== Queue Structure =======================
 *
 * The scheduler uses a 5-level MLFQ to keep track of requests.
 * Each level is a different request priority level.
 *
 * The head of each MLFQ is always the first request in the queue
 * to get dispatched, and the head->next is the next, and so on.
 *
 * The highest priority requests (BIO_RQ_URGENT) entirely skip
 * the queue and are immediately dispatched, giving them no
 * time to get coalesced or reordered.
 *
 * ===================== Request Boosting =======================
 *
 * Over time, requests are boosted according to device specific
 * policies. All of the device specific policies are contained
 * in a per-device `struct bio_scheduler_ops`.
 *
 * Boosts prevent request starvation, as sometimes,
 * requests may not get manually dispatched, and thus
 * spend lots of time in the queue without getting executed.
 *
 * All timestamps for requests are stored in milliseconds, and are taken
 * from the current time during the enqueue.
 *
 * The FIRST boost will occur when a request has spent enough
 * time (`ops->max_wait_time[queue_level]`) in the queue.
 *
 * This is determined via the following for the FIRST boost:
 *
 *     int base_wait = ops->max_wait_time[queue_level];
 *     bool should_boost = current_time > (enqueue_time + base_wait);
 *
 * After the first boost, however, the following
 * boosts become accelerated to prevent large batches
 * of initially low-priority requests from taking up space
 * in higher priority queues.
 *
 * This adjusted timestamp is computed by simply
 * taking the amount of boosts a request has had,
 * and performing the following operation:
 *
 *     int adjusted_wait = base_wait >> req->boost_count;
 *
 * Where the shift can be limited by changing BIO_SCHED_BOOST_SHIFT_LIMIT.
 *
 * In addition to this, the levels that the request is boosted by also changes.
 * The first request will always boost the request by one priority level, but
 * following boosts will be different.
 *
 * The new priority is computed with the following operation:
 *
 *     int get_boost_depth(int boost_count) {
 *         if (boost_count >= 3)
 *             return 2;
 *         else if (boost_count >= 1)
 *             return 1;
 *
 *         return 0;
 *     }
 *
 *     int step = get_boost_depth(req->boost_count);
 *     int new_prio = req->prio + 1 + step; // '1' is the initial boost
 *
 * Where `new_prio` is limited to the BIO_SCHED_MAX priority level.
 *
 * Request starvation is automatically checked every `ops->tick_ms`
 * milliseconds.
