 *
 * The premise of the watchdog is that certain code can lockup/hang.
 * However, as with many supervision programs, we run into a
 * "Who watches the watchers?" (Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?) problem.
 *
 * For instance, in userspace, the runtime/VM watches the program, the
 * OS watches the runtime, and, depending on the OS architecture,
 * the kernel watches the user-facing components.
 *
 * Here, the worker watchdog watches the kernel,
 * and the master watchdog watches the workers.
 *
 * The reason for such an architecture is as follows:
 * When enabled, the master watchdog uses a completely separate pipeline
 * than worker watchdogs, which simultaneously restricts it, and also
 * makes it more powerful. The master watchdog, for instance,
 * does NOT use `struct timer`, which prevents it from failing
 * due to a bug in the timer subsystem. Furthermore, it also
 * operates on a completely separate clock. On x86, for instance,
 * it uses the PIT, whereas the worker watchdogs typically use the LAPIC.
 *
 * And, as the architecture diagram outlines, the master is
 * signaled through an NMI, as opposed to a standard IRQ, which allows
 * it to detect when the *worker* watchdogs do not have heartbeats
 * due to a hard lockup inside of an ISR.
 *
 * Vocabulary:
 *
 * "heartbeats" refer to the events where a watchdog worker receives
 * an interrupt, and acknowledges them. Heartbeats only are
 * incremented/occur at the *end* of the watchdog's execution
 * of callbacks and work, NOT at the beginning
 *
 * "ticks" are watchdog master ticks (different from heartbeats)
 *
 * Lockups are specific cases of hangs where the system fails
 * to respond to interrupts, whereas hangs are the general
 * word for the system failing to respond. Here, we are able
 * to separate the two, i.e. in almost all cases of a lockup,
 * we can report it as a lockup, and not a general purpose hang
 *
 */

/* Notes about the state machine:
 *
 * Every CPU is tracked by the master watchdog according to this state machine.
 *
 * At each state, the behavior regarding the watchdog's tracking of the various
 * CPUs changes.
 *
 * NORMAL = passive observance of heartbeats aggregate in the domain
 * SUSPECT = a few CPUs that were previously NORMAL, pulled for tracking.
 *           for these suspect CPUs, they'll have their lockup_score
 *
 * CRITICAL = CPUs continuously SUSPECT for a while, pulled into this tier
 *            for live examination and IPIs + petting
 *
